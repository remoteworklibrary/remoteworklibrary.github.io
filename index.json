[{"categories":["culture","practice"],"contents":"Breaks are important. Whether at the water cooler, the coffee machine or the tea kettle: Taking breaks, especially together with your colleagues, is important. What usually just happens in normal office routine needs some assistance in a remote work situation.\nWhat is a Virtual Coffee Break? In a normal office environment, coffee breaks (or tea, \u0026hellip;) are part of the daily routine. Many of these coffee breaks are based on the serendipity principle: In these planned or unplanned meetings in the cafeteria or in the office kitchen, unexpected but valuable information is often exchanged and you are talking about topics that one did not expect on the way to the cafeteria. To ensure that serendipity is not lost in Remote Work, various technical solutions and rituals can be used. Because one thing is guaranteed: A remote worker regularly needs joint coffee breaks with his colleagues far away.\nHow to do it? The first step are virtual meeting areas, whose entry barriers should be very low (easy technical access, no closing times or self-service).\nA very simple solution for this is video conferencing, which is active 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. These conferences can be entered as spontaneously as a coffee kitchen and hopefully you will meet nice colleagues there. If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to rely on that, you can use a ritual of getting together. In real office life, you walk through the floor and ask \u0026ldquo;Coffee?\u0026rdquo; or clink the coffee cups a little bit louder and colleagues that have time and desire are attracted. In a remote setting, this ritual can be most easily illustrated with a chat. Create a special \u0026ldquo;Coffee Buddies\u0026rdquo; channel or use your team channel to send a small coffee cup of emoji. This sends a signal to your colleagues: \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to have a coffee now. Who wants to come along? Meet me at the Zoom Coffee Kitchen\u0026rdquo;. An emoji is quickly sent, quickly read or quickly ignored if you want to continue working.\n   img.lazyload { display: none; }    Coffee cup emoji in Slack channel   Scheduled Coffee Breaks If you don\u0026rsquo;t have the possibility of virtual coffee kitchens, you can also set up classic meetings via calendar: One-time, or series. With one colleague or with a group. You decide. You can easily schedule a coffee break meeting in your business calendar (e.g. Google Calendar) and link it to a video conference session (e.g. 1-click solution with Zoom\u0026rsquo;s Google Calendar plugin).\n   Search for the person in calendar Select time and write your purpose (e.g. \u0026ldquo;Coffee Break Session\u0026rdquo;) in the title Add a Zoom meeting  Chatbots Chatbots can be used in this ritual to ensure that as many different people as possible meet in the coffee kitchen and to increase randomness. There are many offers for this in the Slack Marketplace:\n Donut: https://slack.com/apps/A11MJ51SR-donut RandomCoffees: https://slack.com/apps/A5JR8MM6E-randomcoffees Lean Coffee Table: https://slack.com/apps/AC5RRA4N6-lean-coffee-table Snack: https://slack.com/apps/A010GH02MCY-snack  These bots are especially useful for colleagues who are new in a company and want to get in touch with their new colleagues. This is where the random selection of coffee rounds helps enormously. We at QAware use the Donut Chatbot for this. Everybody who wants to join a coffee buddy session has to join the channel \u0026ldquo;Coffee Buddies\u0026rdquo;. The bot randomly sets up buddy rounds once a week with a group of three colleagues. By the calendar integration it is also very easy to find and create a calender invitation (incl. zoom dial-in).

But how can you do remote team events on a larger scale?\nWhat is a Remote Team Event and why use it? Team events offer the opportunity to meet colleagues and team members outside regular work meetings – in a casual atmosphere. Usually we have several company wide events with 100 to 200 participants throughout the year, so we asked ourselves: how can we map that to a remote setting?\nHow to do it? Provide a dedicated and always-open videoconferencing session for virtual coffee breaks as well as a mechanism to see if anybody is in the session before joining to lower the barrier.\nTooling Even though a regular video conferencing tool like Zoom offers to host events with 200 and more participants, it is rather difficult to network as only one person can speak at a time (when one person speaks the other ones are automatically muted). Of course there are break out rooms, with which you can divide the group into smaller groups. But only the host can allocate the team members and it is not possible to see who is in which room.\nTherefore we searched for a tool that can solve these problems and we finally found remo.co. Remo offers simple but helpful features:\n There is an event floor with tables for six people each On the event floor you can see who participates in the event and who is sitting at which table By double-clicking on a table, participants can easily switch between tables At each table you can see the other people sitting at the same table and talk to them (like a mini video conference) As a host you have a broadcast function, with which you can talk to all event participants at the same time It is even possible to design a branded event floor     img.lazyload { display: none; }    Remo example floor plan   All in all Remo offers event participants more rights and due to the floor plan the feeling of being together at the same event is much stronger.\nGames It is always fun to have games at such an event and there are a lot of online games that you can play without being physically together. We were looking for games that do not take a lot of time, do not need a lot of explanation and are great fun. Our favorite game during the event was: skribbl.io: One person gets a word that she/he has to draw with the mouse - the other people have to guess the word in the game chat. The earlier you identify the word, the more points you get. The person with the most points wins the game. – simple but lots of fun!\nCatering On a good event, a good catering cannot be missing. We chose a simple way and gave out online vouchers for a supermarket chain to all event participants. This way everyone could get their favorite food and drinks.\nThe first remote team event went very well and the feedback was amazing. So we will have more remote team events soon.\nFurther information Related items  Video Conferencing ","permalink":"https://www.remoteworklibrary.io/posts/remote-team-events/","tags":["socialize","serendipity"],"title":"Remote Team Events"},{"categories":["practice","tool","culture"],"contents":"Health checks are a special form of feedback from colleagues in the team or company regarding how they are currently doing: mental, satisfaction with processes, tooling and goals.\nWhat is a Team Health Check and why use it? Health checks should normally be part of every retro. But in some situations it is useful to do additional health checks. This is the case, for example, if the frequency of the retros is not so often (\u0026gt; 2 weeks) or retros are not made regularly. Another reason for special health checks may be that team members in the larger video call session are shy and frightened of their personal feedback.\nHow to do it? 1-on-1 Meeting Every manager, team leader, agile master should do a short video call once a week with each team member. In a relaxed atmosphere for a short exchange. How are you doing? What was bothering or causing you problems at the job this week? Maybe I can help you? What did you enjoy most about your job this week? Tell something about your week so that your colleague can get to know your topics.\nIf you work geographically distributed these regular meetings are very important. If you are not working site-by-site in one office, these conversations do not happen by chance. They must be done explicit. They must become routine without becoming boring and redundant. This is not easy. Every manager has to find an authentic way and establish a good relationship to the employees.\nTeam Health Checks A popular model for team health checks was developed by Spotify, the \u0026ldquo;Squad Health Check Model\u0026rdquo;. This model has two goals: What is the current situation and what is the trend. Thus this model is similar to some maturity models.\nWho is the Health Check Model intended for? In the Health Check Model of a Squad (Spotify`s term for a small, interdisciplinary, self-organized development team) there are mainly two stakeholders:\n The Squad itself: By discussing the individual factors, the members of the squad can better understand what works and what doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for them. The wide range of questions helps them to better understand the current state of the team. They may be aware of the quality issues in the code, but they haven\u0026rsquo;t really thought about the value from the customer\u0026rsquo;s point of view or how quickly they can learn. It also highlights both the good things and the negative points. People who support the squad: Managers, coaches, other team leaders who work outside the team get an overview of all the things that work and those that don\u0026rsquo;t work. Additionally, they can see patterns between different squads. If you have dozens of teams and can\u0026rsquo;t talk to everyone about everything, such a summary can help you to find out what\u0026rsquo;s really important.  Being aware of the problem is the first step to solving a problem. This type of visualization makes it much harder to ignore a problem.\n   img.lazyload { display: none; }    Squad Health Check model (source: https://labs.spotify.com)   Mood Checks Health checks in the very small Mood Check format \u0026ldquo;How are you doing: good, ok, bad\u0026rdquo; are not ideal for obtaining detailed and regular feedback from the team. But: They are a good icebreaker for retro meeting.\n   img.lazyload { display: none; }    Mood Check   TeamRetro An exemplary online tool for retros and health checks is TeamRetro. Out of the box, TeamRetro supports a range of health check models.\n Spotify Squad Health Check Team radar Team health check Remote team happiness  You can also create your own templates, depending on the context of your team. If you use the same template more than once, you can track the impact of changes and progress over time in a dashboard.\nAtlassian Project Team Health Monitor Atlassian has also thought about Team Health Checks. The results of their research are eight attributes that healthy and productive teams have in common and for which a regular check-up is therefore rewarding.\n   img.lazyload { display: none; }    Atlassian Project Team Health Monitor (source: atlassian.com)   In an online setting this model can be used e.g. via an online whiteboard like Miro and Mural or via the Confluence Teamplate (link to marketplace).\nFurther information Further content  1-on-1 Meeting Essentials Spotify Squad Health Check Model TeamRetro - What is a Team Health Check?

Digital whiteboards help to transfer this collaborative experience into the digital world.\nWhat is a Digital Whiteboard? Whiteboards only work when the team is in the same space. As work becomes more remote, they are replaced by their digital equivalent. Digital whiteboards help to transfer the collaborative experience of whiteboards into the virtual world. Digital whiteboards are essential in a remote-only setting but also very helpful in hybrid scenarios with distributed teams in different offices, or when some participants are joining from home.\nWhy use it? To enable real-time remote collaboration on whiteboards especially for creative team processes and to stimulate team flow.\nHow to do it? The following picture shows a sample digital whiteboard used for brainstorming based on the tool miro.   img.lazyload { display: none; }  \nHere is our how-to for the different stages of a digital whiteboard session:\n\u0026hellip; prepare a whiteboard session Prepare the session right on the canvas. Try to reflect the meeting agenda directly on the whiteboard: Add the agenda and prepare regions for every agenda item. Visually link the regions according the storyline of the meeting.\nIf the agenda item is a presentation: Include the slides on the whiteboard.\nIf the agenda item is interactive: Choose an appropriate template that facilitates the required group process the most. Good digital whiteboard solutions provide templates for a lot of creative methodologies (like those listed at servicedesigntools.org or Open Practice Library).\nIf the agenda item can be prepared by the team prior to the meeting: Provide the whiteboard upfront and define regions where the participants can insert their content.\nFinally: Lock all parts of the whiteboard which shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be modified during the meeting.\n\u0026hellip; run a whiteboard session Each whiteboard session needs a facilitator who guides the group through the agenda and the corresponding whiteboard. There are basically three different interaction modes during a digital whiteboard session:\n Brainstorming mode, where all participants first insert their ideas, then the ideas are presented and clustered and finally conclusions are derived. Co-edition mode, where a small group of participants (3-5) is editing the same region of the whiteboard simultaneously and all modifications are merged in real-time. Presentation mode, where one participant presents a region of the whiteboard or draws \u0026amp; explains in real-time.  Meeting minutes can be written directly to the whiteboard or on a separate document which is linked to it.\n\u0026hellip; follow-up a whiteboard session After a whiteboard session, it\u0026rsquo;s good practice to send a link to the final whiteboard to all participants and maybe some other effected stakeholders and lock all items on the whiteboard for edits before.\nFurther information Available tools  G2: List of Collaborative Whiteboard Software Digital whiteboards in video conferencing solutions like Zoom, Webex, Teams The leading digital whiteboards: miro and Mural A digital collaboration space for Office 365: Deon Some hardware devices for digital whiteboards: Google Jambaord, Microsoft SurfaceHub  Related items  Video Conferencing Online Retros ","permalink":"https://www.remoteworklibrary.io/posts/tools-digital-whiteboard/","tags":["collaborate"],"title":"Digital Whiteboard"},{"categories":["tool","practice","culture"],"contents":"A Retrospective is an opportunity for the team to inspect itself and to create a plan for improvements to be enacted.\nWhat is an Online Retrospective? According to the Agile Alliance a (heartbeat) retrospective is: \u0026ldquo;The team meets regularly, usually adhering to the rhythm of its iterations, to explicitly reflect on the most significant events to have occurred since the previous such meeting, and take decisions aiming at remediation or improvement.\u0026rdquo;\nAn online retrospective runs a retrospective online with the help of web-based tools.\nWhy use it? According to the Agile Alliance the benefits of a (heartbeat) retrospective are:\n \u0026ldquo;retrospectives leverage the benefits of iterative development: they offer explicit opportunities to improve the team’s performance over the duration of the project retrospectives promote ownership and responsibility by the project team with respect to all aspects of the process; participants can understand the rationale behind all process decisions\u0026rdquo;  An online retrospective transfers these benefits into a remote work setting where all or most of the retro participants are distributed.\nHow to do it? First you\u0026rsquo;ve to choose the structure of the retrospective. Retromat and FunRetrospective are great resources to find effective and fun structures which are mostly defined by the questions they ask. The default questions are: What was good? What to improve?\nA special form of a retrospective are team health checks like those used by Spotify. Good online retro tools also support team health checks.\nAfter the structure is clear and the retro tool is prepared accordingly the retro can be run in several rounds:\nFirst round: Each participant enters the input to the retrospective structure. The team decides whether the input is visible immediately or after the first round is closed.\nSecond round: Each participant presents his/her input and all participants can ask questions of understanding. No discussions!\nThird round: The input is prioritized, clustered and action items are derived as you can see here:   img.lazyload { display: none; }  \nAfter the retrospective, the result is provided to all participants and to other stakeholders. It is good practice to provide feedback to the top lessons learned to the whole organization (e.g. in a Slack channel #lessonslearned) and to use an issue tracking system like JIRA, Trello or Meistertask to track the derived action items.\nFurther information Available tools  TeamRetro Retrium FunRetro Parabol  Retrospective structures  Retromat FunRetrospective Squad Health Checks  Related items  Video Conferencing Health Checks Digital Whiteboard ","permalink":"https://www.remoteworklibrary.io/posts/tools-online-retros/","tags":["collaborate","learn"],"title":"Online Retrospective"},{"categories":["culture"],"contents":"Working remotely - especially from home - can be tough.

Some lack proper working space or equipment, some need to look after their children while working from home. Some miss the strict separation of their work and personal life. We adapt, we improvise, we try our best to keep up, wondering how long it will take for the world to turn back to normal. There will be times in which you\u0026rsquo;re not as productive as you could be. There will be times in which you feel uneasy and alone. Keep in mind that we humans are social beings.

There are some things you can fix by yourself.\nWhat is it and why fix it? WiFi is a so-called shared medium, which means: There\u0026rsquo;s a limited amount of bandwidth, and in crowded areas, there\u0026rsquo;s not enough room for everyone\u0026rsquo;s WiFi. Your WiFi performance is affected not only by the quality of your own equipment, but also by the general frequency congestion, especially if you live in a multi tenant house.\nHow to do it? Before you start optimizing WiFi, check if you can just get rid of it. If you are still not able to run the cable, then it’s time to check your router\u0026rsquo;s WiFi settings (WiFi is good, cable is better).\nWiFi operates on two common frequency bands:\n 2.4 GHz: long range, good transmission through walls and ceilings, widely used, very often congested. Also the only suitable option for REALLY old devices 5 GHz: shorter range, more blockage by walls/ceilings, seldom congested  If you are on 2.4 GHz and having problems, test what happens if you switch to 5 GHz. Not only does it provide more bandwidth, it is usually not as congested as 2.4 GHz. In a large apartment building, it has become almost impossible to run a 2.4 GHz WiFi with acceptable performance.\nIf you are capable of a router that can run 2.4 and 5.0 GHz in parallel, avoid using the same SSID (SSID = Name of the WiFi network) on both frequency bands. Client devices will happily switch between 2.4/5.0 GHz and you won\u0026rsquo;t get stable test results. In that case, it is better to create a separate SSID (i.e. \u0026ldquo;MyWifi-50\u0026rdquo;) and manually switch your client devices to that network, maybe even deleting the credentials for the old one.\nDeeper dive Tools like MetaGeek InSSIDer can measure the network congestion and list the rogue WiFis at your place. Some routers offer the same functionality. Maybe you can convince your neighbor to crank down his super-high intensity WiFi? Higher signal strength makes no-ones WiFi faster, it is just more annoying for the neighbors.\nOh, and by the way, please do your part as well. Test what WiFi output strength you need at your router to reach all locations within your home. The power savings are marginal, but at least you’re not contributing to someone else’s WiFi congestion problems.\nA word about extenders There are several WiFi extenders or repeaters on the market. It\u0026rsquo;s important to understand how these devices work. A repeater is designed to be put in the middle between your router and your PC. It logs into your router\u0026rsquo;s WiFi as a client, then it serves the same WiFi to your PC. By doing that, the overall range of your WiFi is extended, but the network traffic must now be sent twice – to the repeater, then to the router. As a result, the overall throughput between your PC and router is effectively cut in half!\nRepeaters do have their advantages in long-range, low-congestion situations, but this is most likely not what you\u0026rsquo;re currently dealing with.\nRelated items  WiFi is good, cable is better Video Conferencing ","permalink":"https://www.remoteworklibrary.io/posts/optimize-wifi/","tags":["collaborate"],"title":"Optimize your WiFi"},{"categories":["tool"],"contents":"No video call without internet. Right. But why is it slow like in the 90ies even though you purchased a super broadband line from your internet provider?\nWhat is it and why fix it? A remote worker often needs nothing more than his computer and a good internet connection. But what if that\u0026rsquo;s exactly the problem: Too slow, too unstable, too overloaded. Before you consider changing providers or relocating to a different address, check out your equipment on site. According to our analysis, most of the problems are not caused by the internet provider, but by bad WiFi conditions. This article provides alternatives to slow and unstable WiFi connections.\nHow to do it? There’s several components between your laptop and the internet. Their overall performance cannot exceed the performance of their weakest link. Surprisingly often, you can optimize throughput without contacting your internet provider.\nWiFi is good, cable is better No exceptions! Whenever you are able to connect via an ethernet cable instead of WiFi, just do it! Consider this: A common FullHD video stream in a digital meeting is well below 3 MBit/s. Even the (slightly outdated) 54 MBit/s WiFi setups would handle that, if only you could provide a perfect environment. Then reality kicks in and adds latency, congestion and concrete walls. Just run a cable in the first place and save yourself A LOT of trouble.\nGet creative Yes. Running the cable across your house can be a lot of work. It might still be worth the effort, considering the current circumstances. Probably you will be working from home for the next months or a year. Do it early, get the maximum out of it.\nWorkarounds exist for more complex situations. Powerline adapters use the electricity lines in your house to transmit data on top. The Throughput can reach Gigabit and the adapters are not expensive.\n   img.lazyload { display: none; }    Powerline Adapter (source: https://avm.de/produkte/fritzpowerline/fritzpowerline-1260e-wlan-set/)      img.lazyload { display: none; }    Super-flat CAT cable for windowframes (source: https://www.wentronic.com/en/ultra-slim-rj45-window-feed-through-025-m-71411)   Vertical distance can be a bigger problem than horizontal distance. What if your router is in the basement but your workplace is on the 2nd floor? Consider running the cable on the outside wall. Super-flat ethernet cables will fit within window frames and underneath doors. Use RJ45 couplers to connect them. Don’t be too worried about weather conditions, just make sure that you keep the connectors dry and/or cover them in lots of tape. Warning: Never do anything like this with power supply lines (high voltage electricity)!\nIf you just can\u0026rsquo;t reach your desk If you still can’t reach your workplace, would you be able to cover at least part of the distance via cable, to place an additional WiFi access point at a more suitable location?\nWould you be able to relocate your router? Some houses have multiple telephone sockets available. Also, the cable that connects the telephone socket to your router can be even smaller in diameter than a CAT cable.\nJust in case If none of the above works for you, then you\u0026rsquo;ll probably have to stick with WiFi.

A simple honest smile is an instant feedback, for example on a decision made in a meeting. What might be simple in a meeting room quickly becomes a challenge in a video call or in an asynchronous communication via email or messenger. In this case you always have to explicitly aks for feedback, often during a meeting to make the right decisions to have an agreement for the next steps.\nHow to do it? Thumbs up In small meeting rounds it is easiest if you explicitly add a short feedback question with each decision: How do you feel about the decision? Thumbs up, thumbs down or ok? We call these polls \u0026ldquo;Flash Light Polls\u0026rdquo; and they are most easily comparable as a mix of Traffic Light Polls and Muddiest Point (CATs). In a second round participants who have shown their thumbs down can briefly explain their disagreement in one sentence and propose a compromise solution. The goal of this exercise is to enable the moderator to quickly measure the confidence of all participants on a topic.\nIn a remote meeting, such a survey can be technically implemented very quickly:\n In a video conference, each participant holds their thumb or a traffic light card into the camera. Some video conferencing tools offer features for non-verbal communication. For example Zoom     img.lazyload { display: none; }    Zoom non-verbal communication icons   Polls If you don\u0026rsquo;t like analog polls so much, you can use a bunch of digital tools for Instand Feedback polls.\nVideo Conferencing Polls Good video conferencing tools have poll features integrated in their clients.

Depending on the messenger, polls are already included out-of-the-box in the product or can be added as an extension. A very popular extension for Slack and Microsoft teams is Polly.\n  The fastest way to set up an Instant Feedback poll with Polly in Slack are Yes-No questions.

This happens with telepresence hardware.\nWhat is Telepresence? Telepresence groups together technical solutions that promise to solve three problems:\n to make a person feel present at a remote location to make other people feel that there is someone remotely present to be able to perform actions at a remote location (for example with telerobotics)  Why use it? During face-to-face meetings with a small number of remote participants, they are easily overlooked and quickly get lost. Telepresence tooling makes it possible that remote participants are also recognized as part of the presence group and can actively participate in the meeting.\nHow to do it? There are different solutions that address at least one of the three problems mentioned above. Single solutions are cheaper, less complex and can be integrated easily into the remote office everyday business.\nTelepresence cameras Smart camera systems in meeting rooms or offices are a solution to problem #1: As a remote participant you have to be able to see all participants of the face-to-face meeting. The person who is speaking should always be in focus. But if you are familiar with real life meetings you know that the active participant in a meeting can quickly change.\nConference room systems usually solve this problem with a wide-angle camera which permanently captures all participants in a meeting.\n360° cameras with integrated omnidirectional microphones and speakers that support a variety of video conferencing platforms (Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Webex, GotoMeeting, \u0026hellip;) are a good and cost-efficient start. A product line from this category are the Meeting Owl products from Owl Labs. The best feature of Meeting Owl is that the camera automatically focuses on the speaker. The result is an experience that almost feels like sitting side-by-side in one room with the team.\n The Meeting Owl smart video conferencing camera captures 360° video and audio for a near face-to-face experience.\n   Another product in this category is the 360° camera Meeting from Kandao. This camera supports three different modes of operation:\n 360° panorama of all participants and smart auto focus on the current speaker In presentation mode the speaker is always automatically in focus In global mode, two 180° panorama shots are displayed one above the other    Tabletop telepresence Simply explained, tabletop telepresence systems are tablet PCs on a motor-driven arm. The devices are a technical solution for problem 1 and 2. The device is placed on a meeting table as if there is a meeting participant sitting at that position. The remote participant can remotely control his tabletop telepresence system and thus take part in what is happening at the table or on the whiteboard of the meeting room. The hardware components of the tablet are used for communication (microphone, speakers, camera). The participants in the meeting room can see the remote participant on the tablet monitor.\nSystems of this type are best suited if a single person cannot attend a face-to-face meeting. The people in the meeting room can interact with the remote participant\u0026rsquo;s clone in an almost natural way. An example of such a system is KUBI.\n  Telepresence robots Telepresence robots are the all-in-one solution for the three problems mentioned above. In addition to the features of tabletop telepresence systems, telepresence robots allow free movement in the room and, depending on the model, also have grippers or other possibilities for physical interaction. Thus, these systems are also well suited to participate in meetings with position or room transfers.\nAs one can move independently, these systems are also suitable for \u0026ldquo;just cruising around\u0026rdquo; the office, meeting colleagues or have conversations in the coffee kitchen.\nThe first video shows a telepresence robot from Double Robotics in everyday office life at Wework.\n  The second video shows a robot from Origin Robotics with a controllable gripper arm. With this gripper arm simple things like riding an elevator, pressing a light switch, or picking up small things are possible. But you cannot draw a diagram on a whiteboard with it.\n  Further information Available tools  Meeting Owl from OwlLabs Kubi Double Robotics Origin Robotics Best telepresence robots for business in 2020: Double Robotics, OhmniLabs, Meeting Owl, and more  Related items  Video Conferencing ","permalink":"https://www.remoteworklibrary.io/posts/telepresence/","tags":["collaborate","socialize"],"title":"Telepresence"},{"categories":["practice","culture"],"contents":"It\u0026rsquo;s hard to run effective virtual meetings. A remote meeting guideline provides guidance on how to keep them productive.\nWhat is a Remote Meeting Guideline? Running effective meetings is essential for modern businesses - and it\u0026rsquo;s even more difficult when they take place virtually. A remote meeting guideline provides guidance on how to succeed here. It\u0026rsquo;s a collection of rules and best practices on how to run effective virtual meetings.\nWhy use it? Without a special guideline, virtual meetings will more or less be held like meetings in presence. But this leads to inefficiency as successful remote meetings require more facilitation and more discipline. Also, they should not last too long as meeting remotely is more exhausting than meeting on-site.\nHow to do it? A sample remote meeting guideline General rules  Virtual meetings are more exhausting than meetings in presence. No meeting should take more than 2 hours and you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t spend more than 4 hours in remote meetings per day. Remote meetings require more discipline and thus also a strong leadership of a meeting. Each virtual meeting must have an pre-assigned host. Please refer to general meeting hosting and facilitation best practices.  Meeting preparation All participants:\n Take care of an appropriate infrastructure and the required technical setup  Internet access: prefer LAN/PowerLAN connection over WiFi Camera: Notebook cameras are OK, HD USB cameras are way better Audio: The notebook audio setup is mostly not sufficient for video conferences. Use headsets or speakerphones and activate noise and echo reduction.   Take care of having enough to drink for the meeting (e.g. a 1l bottle of water) Form the new habit to join the meeting 2 minutes in advance.  As host:\n Ensure that every participant has access to the agenda and has a video conferencing link to join the meeting. It is good practice keeping this information in the calendar entry. Keep the number of participants as low as possible (5-9). Two suggestions:  \u0026ldquo;no spectators\u0026rdquo;: Do not invite participants only to keep them informed. Everybody should be invited to actively participate and contribute an otherwise missing opinion. \u0026ldquo;free participants from the meeting\u0026rdquo;: Start the meeting with the question if any participant thinks she/he isn\u0026rsquo;t mandatory for the meeting and would prefer not to participate.   Provide an agenda with a schedule and a sufficient number of breaks (communication breaks and rejuvenation breaks). Prepare rules for common pitfalls in remote meetings like: Who talks? In meetings with more than 5 non-steady participants it could be useful that each participant only talks upon request by the host and after digitally raising the hand. For the introduction or feedback rounds the sequence should be made clear for all. Interactive parts require proper preparation: It is often better to collect the participant input upfront or in parallel during the meeting with tools like a common online document, an online retro board, or a digital whiteboard. Prepare the required tools for the remote meeting  for managing the agenda and the meeting minutes (Wiki page like Confluence, online documents like GoogleDocs) for collecting the action items (issue trackers like JIRA or taskboards like Trello or Meistertask) for collaborative digital whiteboard sessions for online retrospectives for breakout sessions (Zoom can handle this on-the-fly. For others separate video conferencing sessions should be prepared as breakout rooms) time timer: Smartphone, real time timer visible in video stream, digital timers like AgilePokerClock or the Online Time Timer.    Running the Meeting All participants:\n always switch on the video. Facial expression and body language are an important part of communication. Only switch the video off if you\u0026rsquo;ve troubles with the internet connection or if you participate in a large meeting where you have no active parts. keep the focus on the meeting  do not work on other tasks in parallel (not even on e-mails and chats) do not use your smartphone do not change the virtual background during the meeting   only one person speaks simultaneously all others mute themselves. Only the host can interrupt. Participants can raise their hand in the chat or with the according feature of the video conferencing solution. take a break for 5-15 min each 60-90 min and come back from the break in time. Keep video and microphones on during the breaks for small talk and networking (take every chance to do team building in remote settings)  As host:\n Take care of the agenda and follow the schedule. It\u0026rsquo;s good practice nominating a time keeper (≠ the host) to take care of the schedule. Use a time timer to make all participants aware of the timebox and the remaining time. Provide an intro to each agenda item setting the context, the goals, the approach, and the desired outcome. Provide a summary after each agenda item and collect the results, the open issues, the action items and next steps. Document all results and provide meeting minutes for all participants and affected stakeholders. It\u0026rsquo;s good practice nominating a recorder to take care of the meeting minutes.

Mob programming is similar to pair programming with the entire team.\nWhat is Mob Programming? Mob programming is a practice where your complete team comes together to implement a small user story or feature. This can be done in one room with one computer or remotely\nWhy use it? Mob Programming helps you to share information about how a problem is solved in your source code or how a specific part of the implementation is realized with the whole team. It is also an option to easily onboard new team members or discuss working methods with the help of a concrete example. As the whole team takes part in decisions, everybody can voice their opinions on the spot. The idea and intention of a solution is automatically spread across the team.\nHow to do it? Like Pair Programming, Remote Mob Programming also has a dedicated role for the person doing the actual coding, it is called \u0026lsquo;typist\u0026rsquo;. The typist writes the program code while sharing the screen for all others (e.g. with video conferencing tool). All participants watch the shared source code and collaborate on solving the problem. They discuss the best solution and tell the typist what to do.\nTips  All team members turn on their video and audio. To ensure all participants stay concentrated and active, the typist role should switch frequently (every 8-10 minutes). Keep the team small! If there are six or more participants, they often are inactive. Try to keep everyone involved. The concept of mob programming can also be used to write documentation or tests.

But how to perform effective collaboration practices like pair programming or code walkthroughs in remote settings?\nWhat is Collaborative Coding? Collaborative coding is about interpreting coding as a collaborative effort and providing tools and practices which improve the depth and productivity of code-level collaboration - especially in fully or partially remote settings.\nWhy use it? Important code-level collaborative practices like pair programming, code walkthroughs, and walking around and ask others for feedback do not work out-of-the-box in remote settings.\nHow to do it? There are at least three different kinds of collaborative code practices which can be enabled by different kinds of tools:\n Social coding: Code sharing and accessibility (with tools like GitHub, Gitlab), and Bitbucket Driver / navigator pattern: The driver writes code, and the navigator tells the driver what to do. Driver and navigator swap their roles from time to time. You need nothing more than a video conferencing solution for a driver / navigator collaboration. Code discussions: Comment, peer review, and discuss code with inline comments, Google Docs like commenting \u0026amp; suggestion features (e.g. provided by codestream, TeamHub), peer review tools (like Upsource), or pull/merge requests in social coding tools. Co-creation: Writing code together simultaneously by working in a shared editor. Changes of everybody are visible in realtime. There are desktop-level co-creation tools like USE together which are not stitched to any dev tool or realtime collaboration editors like floobits, VS.code Live Share, or Atom Teletype  Further information Related items  Mob Programming Video Conferencing ","permalink":"https://www.remoteworklibrary.io/posts/collaborative-coding/","tags":["collaborate","learn"],"title":"Collaborative Coding"},{"categories":["tool"],"contents":"Video conferencing is a fundamental technology in remote work settings.
