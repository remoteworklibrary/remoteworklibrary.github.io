Telepresence groups together technical solutions that promise to solve three problems\n to make a remote person feel present at a remote location to make other people feel that there is someone remotely present to be able to perform actions at a remote location (for example with telerobotics)  Why use it? In face-to-face meetings with a small number of remote participants, they are very easily overlooked and quickly get lost during a meeting. Telepresence tooling makes it possible that these participants are also recognized as part of the presence group and can actively participate in the meeting.\nHow to do it? For the troublesome situations described in the teaser exists solutions that solve one problem or even all of them. Single solutions are cheaper, less complex and can be integrated very easily into the remote office everyday business.\nTelepresence cameras Smart camera systems in meeting rooms or offices are the solution to problem #1: As a remote participant you have to be able to see all participants of the presence meeting. The person who is currently speaking should always be in focus. But if your are familiar with real life meetings you know that the active participant in a meeting can change very quickly and it rarely ends with one active person.\nConference room systems usually solve this problem with a wide-angle camera which permanently captures all participants in a meeting.\n360° cameras with integrated omnidirectional microphones and speakers that support a variety of video conferencing platforms (Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Webex, GotoMeeting, \u0026hellip;) are a good and cost-efficient start. A product line from this category are the Meeting Owl products of the manufacturer Owl Labs. The best feature of Meeting Owl is that the camera automatically focuses on the speaker. The result is an experience that almost feels like sitting side-by-side in a real room with the team.\n The Meeting Owl smart video conferencing camera captures 360° video and audio for a near face-to-face experience.\n   Another product in this category is the 360° camera Meeting from Kandao. This camera supports three different modes of operation:\n 360° panorama of all participants and smart auto focus on the current speaker In presentation mode the speaker is always automatically shot In Global mode, two 180° panorama shots are displayed one above the other    Tabletop telepresence Simply explained, tabletop telepresence systems are tablet PCs on a motor-driven arm. The devices are a technical solution for problem 1 and 2. These devices are placed on a meeting table as if there were a meeting participant sitting at that position. The remote participant can remotely control his tabletop telepresence system and thus take part in what is happening at the table or on the whiteboard of the meeting room. The hardware components of the tablet are used for communication (microphone, speakers, camera). The participants in the meeting room can see the remote participant on the tablet monitor.\nSystems of this type are best suited if a single person cannot attend a face-to-face meeting. The people in the meeting room can interact with the remote participant\u0026rsquo;s clone in an almost natural way. An example of such a system is KUBI.\n  Telepresence robots Telepresence robots are the all-in-one solution for the three problems mentioned above. In addition to the features of tabletop systems, telepresence robots allow free movement in the room and, depending on the model, also have grippers or other possibilities for physical interactivity. Thus, these systems are also well suited to easily participate in meetings with position or room transfers.\nBecause one can move independently from other people in office rooms, these systems are also suitable for \u0026ldquo;just cruising around\u0026rdquo;. Walking around meeting and also occasional water cooler conversations become possible.\nThe first video shows a telepresence robot from Double Robotics in everyday office life at Wework.\n  The second video shows a robot from Origin Robotics with a controllable gripper arm. This makes simple things like riding an elevator, pressing a light switch, or picking up small things possible. But you cannot draw a diagram on a whiteboard with it.\n  Further information Available tools  Meeting Owl from OwlLabs Kubi Double Robotics Origin Robotics Best telepresence robots for business in 2020: Double Robotics, OhmniLabs, Meeting Owl, and more  Related items  Video Conferencing Virtual Coffee Breaks ","permalink":"https://www.remoteworklibrary.io/posts/telepresence/","tags":["tool"],"title":"Telepresence"},{"categories":["collaborate"],"contents":"It\u0026rsquo;s hard to run effective virtual meetings. A remote meeting guideline provides guidance on how to keep them productive.\nWhat is a Remote Meeting Guideline? Running effective meetings is essential for modern businesses - and it\u0026rsquo;s even more difficult when they take place virtually. A remote meeting guideline provides guidance on how to succeed here. It\u0026rsquo;s a collection of rules and best practices on how to run effective virtual meetings.\nWhy use it? Without a special guideline, virtual meetings will more or less be held like meetings in presence. But this leads to inefficiency as successful remote meetings require more facilitation and more discipline. Also, they should not last too long as meeting remotely is more exhausting than meeting on-site.\nHow to do it? A sample remote meeting guideline General rules  Virtual meetings are more exhausting than meetings in presence. No meeting should take more than 2 hours and you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t spend more than 4 hours in remote meetings per day. Remote meetings require more discipline and thus also a strong leadership of a meeting. Each virtual meeting must have an pre-assigned host. Please refer to general meeting hosting and facilitation best practices.  Meeting preparation All participants:\n Take care of an appropriate infrastructure and the required technical setup  Internet access: prefer LAN/PowerLAN connection over WiFi Camera: Notebook cameras are OK, HD USB cameras are way better Audio: The notebook audio setup is mostly not sufficient for video conferences. Use headsets or speakerphones and activate noise and echo reduction.   Take care of having enough to drink for the meeting (e.g. a 1l bottle of water) Form the new habit to join the meeting 2 minutes in advance.  As host:\n Ensure that every participant has access to the agenda and has a video conferencing link to join the meeting. It is good practice keeping this information in the calendar entry. Keep the number of participants as low as possible (5-9). Two suggestions:  \u0026ldquo;no spectators\u0026rdquo;: Do not invite participants only to keep them informed. Everybody should be invited to actively participate and contribute an otherwise missing opinion. \u0026ldquo;free participants from the meeting\u0026rdquo;: Start the meeting with the question if any participant thinks she/he isn\u0026rsquo;t mandatory for the meeting and would prefer not to participate.   Provide an agenda with a schedule and a sufficient number of breaks (communication breaks and rejuvenation breaks). Prepare rules for common pitfalls in remote meetings like: Who talks? In meetings with more than 5 non-steady participants it could be useful that each participant only talks upon request by the host and after digitally raising the hand. For the introduction or feedback rounds the sequence should be made clear for all. Interactive parts require proper preparation: It is often better to collect the participant input upfront or in parallel during the meeting with tools like a common online document, an online retro board, or a digital whiteboard. Prepare the required tools for the remote meeting  for managing the agenda and the meeting minutes (Wiki page like Confluence, online documents like GoogleDocs) for collecting the action items (issue trackers like JIRA or taskboards like Trello or Meistertask) for collaborative digital whiteboard sessions for online retrospectives for breakout sessions (Zoom can handle this on-the-fly. For others separate video conferencing sessions should be prepared as breakout rooms) time timer: Smartphone, real time timer visible in video stream, digital timers like AgilePokerClock or the Online Time Timer.    Running the Meeting All participants:\n always switch on the video. Facial expression and body language are an important part of communication. Only switch the video off if you\u0026rsquo;ve troubles with the internet connection or if you participate in a large meeting where you have no active parts. keep the focus on the meeting  do not work on other tasks in parallel (not even on e-mails and chats) do not use your smartphone do not change the virtual background during the meeting   only one person speaks simultaneously all others mute themselves. Only the host can interrupt. Participants can raise their hand in the chat or with the according feature of the video conferencing solution. take a break for 5-15 min each 60-90 min and come back from the break in time. Keep video and microphones on during the breaks for small talk and networking (take every chance to do team building in remote settings)  As host:\n Take care of the agenda and follow the schedule. It\u0026rsquo;s good practice nominating a time keeper (≠ the host) to take care of the schedule. Use a time timer to make all participants aware of the timebox and the remaining time. Provide an intro to each agenda item setting the context, the goals, the approach, and the desired outcome. Provide a summary after each agenda item and collect the results, the open issues, the action items and next steps. Document all results and provide meeting minutes for all participants and affected stakeholders. It\u0026rsquo;s good practice nominating a recorder to take care of the meeting minutes.

Mob programming is similar to pair programming with the entire team.\nWhat is Mob Programming? Mob programming is a practice where your complete team comes together to implement a small user story or feature.\nWhy use it? Mob Programming helps you to share information about how a problem is solved in your source code or how a specific part of the implementation is realized with the whole team. It is also an option to easily onboard new team members or discuss working methods with the help of a concrete example.\nHow to do it? Like Pair Programming, Mob Programming also has the roles of \u0026lsquo;driver\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;navigator\u0026rsquo;. The driver writes the program code while sharing the screen for all others (e.g. with video conferencing tool). All participants watch the shared source code and collaborate on solving the problem. One of the team members has the role of the navigator (this role switches) and tells the driver what to do.\nTips  All team members turn on their video and audio. To ensure all participants stay concentrated and active, the role should switch frequently (every 2-3 minutes) and the team should not be too large. If there are five or more participants, they oftern are inactive. The concept of mob programming can also be used to write documentation or tests.

But how to perform effective collaboration practices like pair programming or code walkthroughs in remote settings?\nWhat is Collaborative Coding? Collaborative coding is about interpreting coding as a collaborative effort and providing tools and practices which improve the depth and productivity of code-level collaboration - especially in fully or partially remote settings.\nWhy use it? Important code-level collaborative practices like pair programming, code walkthroughs, and walking around and ask others for feedback do not work out-of-the-box in remote settings.\nHow to do it? There are at least three different kinds of collaborative code practices which can be enabled by different kinds of tools:\n  Social coding: Code sharing and accessibility (with tools like GitHub, Gitlab), and Bitbucket\n  Driver / navigator pattern: The driver writes code, and the navigator tells the driver what to do. Driver and navigator swap their roles from time to time. You need nothing more than a video conferencing solution for a driver / navigator collaboration.\n  Code discussions: Comment, peer review, and discuss code with inline comments, Google Docs like commenting \u0026amp; suggestion features (e.g. provided by codestream, TeamHub), peer review tools (like Upsource), or pull/merge requests in social coding tools.\n  Co-creation: Writing code together simultaneously by working in a shared editor.

Digital whiteboards help to transfer this collaborative experience into the digital world.\nWhat is a Digital Whiteboard? Whiteboards only work when the team is in the same space. As work becomes more remote, they are replaced by their digital equivalent. Digital whiteboards help to transfer the collaborative experience of whiteboards into the virtual world. Digital whiteboards are essential in a remote-only setting but also very helpful in hybrid scenarios with distributed teams in different offices, or when some participants are joining from home.\nWhy use it? To enable real-time remote collaboration on whiteboards especially for creative team processes and to stimulate team flow.\nHow to do it? The following picture shows a sample digital whiteboard used for brainstorming based on the tool miro. Here is our how-to for the different stages of a digital whiteboard session:\n\u0026hellip; prepare a whiteboard session Prepare the session right on the canvas. Try to reflect the meeting agenda directly on the whiteboard: Add the agenda and prepare regions for every agenda item. Visually link the regions according the storyline of the meeting.\nIf the agenda item is a presentation: Include the slides on the whiteboard.\nIf the agenda item is interactive: Choose an appropriate template that facilitates the required group process the most. Good digital whiteboard solutions provide templates for a lot of creative methodologies (like those listed at servicedesigntools.org or Open Practice Library).\nIf the agenda item can be prepared by the team prior to the meeting: Provide the whiteboard upfront and define regions where the participants can insert their content.\nFinally: Lock all parts of the whiteboard which shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be modified during the meeting.\n\u0026hellip; run a whiteboard session Each whiteboard session needs a facilitator who guides the group through the agenda and the corresponding whiteboard. There are basically three different interaction modes during a digital whiteboard session:\n Brainstorming mode, where all participants first insert their ideas, then the ideas are presented and clustered and finally conclusions are derived. Co-edition mode, where a small group of participants (3-5) is editing the same region of the whiteboard simultaneously and all modifications are merged in real-time. Presentation mode, where one participant presents a region of the whiteboard or draws \u0026amp; explains in real-time.  Meeting minutes can be written directly to the whiteboard or on a separate document which is linked to it.\n\u0026hellip; follow-up a whiteboard session After a whiteboard session, it\u0026rsquo;s good practice to send a link to the final whiteboard to all participants and maybe some other effected stakeholders and lock all items on the whiteboard for edits before.\nFurther information Available tools  G2: List of Collaborative Whiteboard Software Digital whiteboards in video conferencing solutions like Zoom, Webex, Teams The leading digital whiteboards: miro and Mural A digital collaboration space for Office 365: Deon Some hardware devices for digital whiteboards: Google Jambaord, Microsoft SurfaceHub,  Related items  Video Conferencing Online Retros ","permalink":"https://www.remoteworklibrary.io/posts/tools-digital-whiteboard/","tags":["tool"],"title":"Digital Whiteboard"},{"categories":["collaborate","learn"],"contents":"A Retrospective is an opportunity for the Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted.\nWhat is it? According to the Agile Alliance a (heartbeat) retrospective is: The team meets regularly, usually adhering to the rhythm of its iterations, to explicitly reflect on the most significant events to have occurred since the previous such meeting, and take decisions aiming at remediation or improvement.\nA Online Retrospective runs a retrospective online with the help of web-based tools.\nWhy use it? According to the Agile Alliance the benefits of a (heartbeat) retrospective are:\n retrospectives leverage the benefits of iterative development: they offer explicit opportunities to improve the team’s performance over the duration of the project retrospectives promote ownership and responsibility by the project team with respect to all aspects of the process; participants can understand the rationale behind all process decisions  A Online Retrospective transfers these benefits into a remote setting where all or most of the retro participants are distributed.\nHow to do it? First you\u0026rsquo;ve to choose the structure of the retrospective. Retromat and FunRetrospective are great resources to find effective and fun structures which are mostly defined by the questions they ask. The default questions are: What was good? What to improve?\nA special form of a retrospective are team health checks like those used by Spotify. Good online retro tools also support team health checks.\nAfter the structure is clear and the retro tool is prepared accordingly the retro can be run in several rounds:\nFirst round. Each participant enters the input to the retrospective structure. The team decides wether the input is visible immediately or after the first round is closed.\nSecond round. Each participant presents his/her input and all participants can ask questions of understanding. No discussions!\nThird round. The input is prioritized, clustered and action items are derived as you can see here: After the retrospective the result is provided to all participants and to other stakeholders. It is good practice to provide feedback to the top lessons learned to the whole organization (e.g. in a Slack channel #lessionslearned) and to use an issue tracking system like JIRA, Trello or Meistertask to track the derived action items.\nFurther information Available tools  TeamRetro Retrium FunRetro Parabol  Retrospective structures  Retromat FunRetrospective Squad Health Checks  Related items  Video Conferencing Online Retros ","permalink":"https://www.remoteworklibrary.io/posts/tools-online-retros/","tags":["tool","practice","culture"],"title":"Online Retrospective"}]
